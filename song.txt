Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
You let her go

Only know you love her when you let her go
You let her go

Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow, and they go so fast

You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day, you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies
